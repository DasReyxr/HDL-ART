# VHDL Practice: Full Adder, Carry-Skip Adder, and Multiplier

This repository contains VHDL implementations and testbenches for fundamental arithmetic circuits, including a **Full Adder**, a **Carry-Skip Adder**, and a **Multiplier**.

## 📝 Description

This practice focuses on designing and simulating three essential arithmetic circuits using **VHDL**:

1. **Full Adder** – A basic 1-bit adder that sums two bits with a carry-in.
2. **Carry-Skip Adder** – A fast adder that improves performance by reducing carry propagation delay.
3. **Multiplier** – A combinational multiplier for multiplying binary numbers.

Each module includes:
- **VHDL code** for implementation.
- **Testbench** for simulation.
- **Waveform analysis** using ModelSim or other VHDL simulators.
